1. We first login as a recruiter, for Microsoft on the web 
	application, shown on the leftmost window.

2. The recruiter clicks on 'View Students' to view a maximum of
 10 students in line

3. As students move ahead, recruiters have the option of 
marking a student as starred, no-show, or next.

4. A student 'priyanka' is at the end of the Microsoft line 

5. We will log in a student 'Priyanka' on the phone application.
 The 'Other Companies' page displays a list of company queues 
which Priyanka has not yet joined. Each entry displays the 
length of the queue.

6. The 'Joined Queues'page displays 'Microsoft', along with
Priyanka's token number and the number of people ahead of her
in line.

7. Another student 'nithya' now logs in through her phone.
She has not yet joined any companies.

8. She joins the Microsoft line.

9. Nithya is next in line after Priyanka, as can be seen from 
their 'My token' and 'People ahead' fields for Microsoft.

10. Meanwhile, the recruiter has been talking to students. He
likes Adrien's profile, and 'stars' Adrien's resume to view later.

11. The system realizes that there are only 3 people ahead of
Priyanka in the Microsoft line, and sends a notification to her
to join the queue physically. It gives her options to confirm
her position, or to leave.

12. Priyanka realizes that she cannot make it, and chooses to 
leave the queue.

13. 2 things to notice:
   a. Nithya gets a notification to join
the Microsoft line now that there are only 3 people ahead
   b. The recruiter's view of the queue no longer has 'Priyanka'

14. Nithya chooses to confirm her position in the physical queue

15. The recruiter moves onto the next student using 'Next' and 
marks someone as 'No-show' in the event they confirm their
presence and still do not turn up in the queue.

16. The recruiter can finally view the list of starred students
along with their resumes.
